## Ingredients
### **Sauce**

- 1 tbsp olive oil

- 4-5 cloves garlic
- 1 tbsp tomato paste
- Oregano to taste

### **Pasta**

## Method
### **Meat Prep (Can be done 1 day ahead)**
1. Trim fat off lamb shanks and store in container for later. Then, pat dry and salt lamb shanks. This should be done as many days ahead as possibly.
2. Place dry-brined lamb shanks on baking rack on top of a baking sheet. Fill the baking sheet with water.
3. Place baking sheet in a 325F oven for 3 hours. At 1.5 hours, add more water to the baking sheet to prevent burning.
### **Sauce Prep**
1. Heat dutch oven or high walled oven-safe pan until water beads on the pan surface when splashed.
2. Place fat trimmings in pot with 1bsp olive oil. Cook on medium heat until all trimmings are very crispy and golden brown, then remove the fat trimmings leaving the rendered fat.
3. Add crushed or minced garlic in the rendered fat. Once golden, add chili flakes and 1tbsp tomato paste. Cook for 3 minutes or until fragrant.
4. Add 1 can pureed tomatoes and 2 cups water, mix to combine.
5. Add lamb shanks to mixture, cook until sauce is bubbling.
6. Place whole pot into 325F oven for 1.5 hours or until lamb shanks can be cut with a spoon.
7. Remove bone from the lamb shank and shred the meat in the mixture with a fork.
### **Pasta Prep**
1. Add salt to a boiling pot of water, then add pasta and cook until almost al dente (cross section of pasta has a dot of white when bitten into).
2. Once the pasta is almost al dente, reserve 1/2 cup pasta water and drain.
3. Add pasta and reserved pasta water to the sauce, cook on medium low until sauce is at desired consistency.
4. Serve as soon as it is ready.
**Note**
If you want to make this ahead, undercook the pasta and add 100ml more pasta water to the sauce when adding the pasta. Cook the pasta in the sauce until the sauce is loose so that when reheated the sauce and pasta will finish properly.
